# App SDK Quickstart Guide

Get up and running quickly with the Sanity App SDK by following this step-by-step guide!

## Create a new App SDK app

Initialize a new project by running `npx sanity@latest`: 

**npm**

```shell
npx sanity@latest init --template app-quickstart
```

**pnpm**

```shell
pnpm dlx sanity@latest init --template app-quickstart
```

**yarn**

```shell
yarn dlx sanity@latest init --template app-quickstart
```

**bun**

```shell
bunx sanity@latest init --template app-quickstart
```

When prompted:

- Select **yes** when asked to install the sanity package
- Choose your organization, or create a new one
- Specify a location to save your project locally
- Choose whether you want to work with TypeScript or JavaScript

Once you've worked through these options, the CLI should proceed to install all the necessary dependencies, and report back with a confirmation.

**Terminal**

```text
✅ Success! Your custom app has been scaffolded.
(cd my-cool-project to navigate to your new project directory)

Next, configure the project(s) and dataset(s) your app should work with.

Get started in `src/App.tsx`, or refer to our documentation for a walkthrough:
https://sanity.io/docs/app-sdk/sdk-configuration
```

## Navigate to the project directory

If you chose to install your project in a folder different to the current directory, such as a sub-folder, navigate into the project root.

**Terminal**

```sh
cd my-cool-project
```

## Inspect the project folder

In your favorite editor, open the project root and have a look around. Note the `sanity.cli.ts`, `App.tsx`, and `ExampleComponent.tsx` files in particular.

> [!TIP]
> JS|TS|JSX|TSX
> For readability we won't note every time a file could be either a `js/jsx`-file or a `ts/tsx`-file. We'll default to showing the examples inTypeScript going forth. If you are working in JavaScript, replace those T's with J's!

### sanity.cli.ts

This is the main configuration for your project . By default, it contains the unique ID for your organization, and the entrypoint for your app.

**sanity.cli.ts**

```
import {defineCliConfig} from 'sanity/cli'

export default defineCliConfig({
  app: {
    organizationId: 'your-org-id',
    entry: './src/App.tsx',
  },
})
```

### src/App.tsx

This is the main entrypoint for your application. It contains the `<SanityApp />` context provider, and demonstrates how to connect your application to an existing Sanity project. The `<SanityApp />` component provides child components with the necessary context to use the SDK React hooks to interact with the content in your project.

**Before moving on,** modify the `config` variable to include the `projectId` and `dataset` for the Sanity project you’d like to work with in your custom app.

**src/App.tsx**

```tsx
import {type SanityConfig} from '@sanity/sdk'
import {SanityApp} from '@sanity/sdk-react'
import {ExampleComponent} from './ExampleComponent'
import './App.css'  
  
export default function App() {
  // apps can access one or many different projects or other sources of data
  const config: SanityConfig[] = [
    {
      projectId: 'project-id',
      dataset: 'dataset-name',
    }
  ]
  
  return (
    <div className="app-container">
      <SanityApp config={config} fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        {/* add your own components here! */}
        <ExampleComponent />
      </SanityApp>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### src/ExampleComponent.tsx

This component just displays some static content to welcome you to your project. Feel free to get rid of it, or use it as a springboard to write something cooler.

**src/ExampleComponent.tsx**

```tsx
import './ExampleComponent.css'

export function ExampleComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="example-container">
      <h1 className="example-heading">Welcome to your Sanity App!</h1>
      <p className="example-text">
        This is an example component. You can replace this with your own content
        by creating a new component and importing it in App.tsx.
      </p>
      <div className="code-hint">
        <p>Quick tip: Create new components in separate files and import them like this in App.tsx / App.jsx:</p>
        <pre>{`import {YourComponent} from './YourComponent'

// Then use it in your JSX 
<SanityApp config={config}>
  <YourComponent />
</SanityApp>`}</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

```

## Start the development server

It's time to actually run the app! Enter the following command in your terminal:

**npm**

```shell
npm run dev
```

**pnpm**

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

**yarn**

```shell
yarn run dev
```

**bun**

```shell
bun run dev
```

You should see the CLI reporting on its progress.

**Terminal**

```sh
✓ Checking configuration files...
✓ Starting dev server
Dev server started on port 3333
View your app in the Sanity dashboard here:
https://sanity.io/@your-org-id?dev=http://localhost:3333
```

Once having successfully launched your app, the CLI will provide you with a URL where you can see it running locally in the Sanity Dashboard. Open this link in your browser to see the Dashboard front page, then locate your application in the sidebar.

> [!CAUTION]
> During development, SDK apps may experience connection issues in the Safari browser. This is caused by the way Safari handles mixed content, and how Sanity loads your local app in the Dashboard. To get around this limitation, we suggest using another browser during development.
> This does not affect deployed SDK applications.

![a welcome to your sanity app page](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/3do82whm/next/dcd155e20ae9696632da4c0114811d3aaeb282d5-1229x935.png)

## Deploy your app

Finally, when you are happy with your custom app, it's time to deploy it. Run the following command:

**npm**

```shell
npx sanity@latest deploy
```

**pnpm**

```shell
pnpm dlx sanity@latest deploy
```

**yarn**

```shell
yarn dlx sanity@latest deploy
```

**bun**

```shell
bunx sanity@latest deploy
```

Your custom app will be deployed and made available in your organization dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

If you see an error about the port being in use:

- Kill any existing process using port 3333, or
- Start the dev server on a different port:

**npm**

```shell
npm run dev -- --port 3334
```

**pnpm**

```shell
pnpm run dev -- --port 3334
```

**yarn**

```shell
yarn run dev -- --port 3334
```

**bun**

```shell
bun run dev -- --port 3334
```

If you see an error about missing authorization:

- Make sure your user account has the appropriate privileges
- Log out and back in to Sanity

**npm**

```shell
npx sanity@latest logout

npx sanity@latest login
```

**pnpm**

```shell
pnpm dlx sanity@latest logout

pnpm dlx sanity@latest login
```

**yarn**

```shell
yarn dlx sanity@latest logout

yarn dlx sanity@latest login
```

**bun**

```shell
bunx sanity@latest logout

bunx sanity@latest login
```
